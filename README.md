# Auto Game Master

This repository provides the code for an auto DM for Dungons and Dragons 5e via Alexa or web interface.

## Using the Auto DM

The user can request a monster, NPC, encounter, or plot arc by challenge rating, environment, or both. Monsters come from the Monster Manual, Volo's Guide to Monsters, and Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes.
